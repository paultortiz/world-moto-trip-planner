# World Moto Trip Planner

This project will be an application that uses Google Maps to help plan and visualize motorcycle trips around the world.

Planned high-level features:
- Plot multi-day motorcycle routes on a map
- Add waypoints for points of interest, fuel stops, and lodging
- Estimate distances and travel times between segments
- Store and revisit saved trips and itineraries

Project stack and detailed architecture will be defined after project initialization rules are applied.
